        We ship delivery duties unpaid (DDU). As such, any customs or import duties are charged once the parcel reaches the destination country. These charges must be paid by the recipient of the parcel. Unfortunately, we have no control over these charges, and cannot tell you what the cost would be, as customs policies and import duties vary widely from country to country. Please contact your local customs office for information on these prices, so you are not surprised by additional charges.
